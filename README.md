Peep Chatbot
Peep serves as a low-maintenance diary
Focused on small-scale joys and achievements
Recalls user memories on bad days

## App Guidelines
We used Flask and Google App Engine to run the chatbot through Messenger. For the database of the messages, we fetched from and wrote the data to a spreadsheet using Google Developer API.
